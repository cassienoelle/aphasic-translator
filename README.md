# Aphasic Translator
### Author: Cassie Smith

Aphasic Translator is an interactive web app and algorithmic exploration of Wernicke's aphasia. Aphasia is a communication disorder caused by damage to one or more of the language processing centres in the brain. Damage often occurs as a result of a stroke, head injury, or brain tumor. Almost 180,000 people are diagnosed with aphasia each year in the US alone.

Wernicke's aphasia — also known as fluent aphasia — is the result of damage to "Wernicke's area", located in the temporal lobe near the auditory cortex. People with Wernicke's aphasia struggle to understand language, but can express themselves fluently, in full sentences, with ease. However, they often use incorrect or incomprehensible words. Though these words may seem totally random, at times a correlation can be found with what the person is actually trying to say. The result may be otherwise normal speech peppered with occasional errors or, in more severe cases, a "word salad" that takes on a Dadaist poetic.

Aphasic Translator explores the pseudo-random nature of this phenomenon. The app receives audio input from the user and employs speech-recognition to analyze the content of speech. It algorithmically replaces some words with others, while preserving overall grammatical structure. The app produces changes with varying levels of randomness in an attempt to mimic the way someone with Wernicke's aphasia might speak. The output can range from funny, to poignant, to bizarre, forcing the viewer to shift perspective and draw new linguistic associations.
